"Data_Input.zip": The primary dataset for this analysis was drawn from the 2017 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) California cleaned version. (https://www.nrel.gov/transportation/secure-transportation-data/tsdc-nhts-california) The dataset included OD trip data and related vehicle and household information. The data was downloaded on October 28, 2025. <br>

"model-11.30-FinalVersion.py": The coding for the translog model and the formulation of mileage tax. The three txt files "regression_result_rural/urban/total" are results for regression. The "TaxBurden_translog-11.30.xlsx" includes the final translog model used (with regression coefficients) and the calculated mileage taxes in three scenarios in our study. <br>
